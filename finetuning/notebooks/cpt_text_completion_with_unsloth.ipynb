    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will learn how to use Continued Pre-training (CPT) with Unsloth to adapt a language model for text completion and generation tasks.\n",
    "We will use the [LFM2.5-1.2B-Base](https://docs.liquid.ai/docs/models/lfm25-1.2b-base) model and perform continued pre-training on the Tiny Stories dataset. This approach teaches the model domain-specific knowledge, writing styles, and creative text generation patterns. It's ideal for tasks like novel writing, creative content generation, or adapting models to specific narrative styles.\n",
